## Features

- Browse a variety of food recipes with detailed instructions.
- Search for specific recipes based on ingredients or cuisine.
- Save favorite recipes for quick access.
- Explore new and popular recipes added regularly.

## Technologies and Libraries

The app utilizes the following technologies and libraries:

- **Hilt:** For dependency injection, making the codebase clean and modular.
- **Retrofit:** A powerful HTTP client for making network requests to fetch recipe data.
- **Room Database:** SQLite database library for local storage of recipe information.
- **Kotlin Coroutines:** Used for managing asynchronous tasks, ensuring smooth performance.
- **Data Binding:** Enables UI components in layouts to be bound to data sources in the app.
- **MVVM Design Pattern:** Separates the presentation and business logic for a maintainable codebase.

## Usage
Explore the codebase to understand how Hilt, Retrofit, Room Database, Kotlin Coroutines, and Data Binding are implemented in an MVVM architecture. Use this project as a reference for building scalable and maintainable Android applications.

## Food Recipe API
This app relies on the Spoonacular API for fetching food recipe data. Make sure to check their documentation for more details.
